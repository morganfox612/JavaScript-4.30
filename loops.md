# Control Flow in JavaScript

## for/of loop
This loop will execute one time for however many items there are in the collection you run it on.
Example:

```
for (item of collection {
  // run function on an individual item
}
```

## While Loop
This loop will execute forever while the passed in condition is true. It will stop when the condition becomes false.

```
 while (condition == true) {
   // do this
 }
```

## If statement
An if statement will execute a specified block of code only if the passed in condition is true.

```
 if (condition == true) {
   //do this
 }
 ```

 ## If/else statement
 Just like an If statement, but it will execute the else block of code if the condition evaluates to false.

 ```
  if (condition == true) {
    // run only if condition was true
  } else {
    // run only if condition was false
  }
  ```
