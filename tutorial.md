# Functions
A function is a collection of code that can be executed by calling its name

It is best to name functions after verbs. Functions are not executed until their name is called with parenthesis(). Writing the function name simply represents the function itself.

Functions can accept parameters (often called arguments). A parameter/argument is a data type or object that the function will operate on. Parameters/arguments are placed in the parenthesis when calling the function. Multiple arguments are separated by a comma.

Even if a function takes no arguments you still have to write the parenthesis to execute it.

# Variables
variables in JavaScript are declared by using the let, var or const keywords. The keyword you use determines the scope of the variable.
You can declare a variable without a keyword and it will be a global variable.

# Objects
Objects have properties that can be accessed using dot(.) notation
When using dot notation, you are requesting information or an action for that object. The part after the dot is either a property of the object or a function. Example: document.write
